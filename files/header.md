<h1 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 50px" >ðŸŒ± Studio Images Blog</h1>
<p> My studio blog featuring images of paintings, drawings, sculptures and mixed media works from my personal studio practice. Generated and updated by a selenium script that scrapes a publicly accessible iCloud album that is easy to update and edit from my mobile device.</p>
<p>This mini-project is an experiment to see if it's feasible to maintain a free artists portfolio website via an iCloud album. Shared iCloud albums are easy to add to and edit through Apple's mobile Photos app, and it seemed like it might be an easy way to maintain some artists websites without asking anything extra of the artists technically. The project is dependent on regularly running a single Python script that scrapes the public url for an iCloud album and processes its current state into static html and markdown files.</p>
<p>So far it seems to be a fun and easy way to post and share studio images, we'll see how it works out as I try to expand it to maintain multiple sites and maybe some automated social media posts! ðŸ¤ž</p>
